# Canonical schema for a resource. Copy this file to _resources/<slug>.md and
# delete what does not apply. Excluded from the build.

# Belt and braces. `exclude:` in _config.yml already keeps this file out of the
# build; this line means it still renders nothing if that entry is ever lost.
# Delete it in your copy, or the resource will not appear.
published: true

# REQUIRED. The resource's name. This is the page title and the index row.
title: "Quantum Foundations"

# Groups the index page. Free text — "Lecture notes", "Reading list",
# "Software", "Preprints", "Link" are the categories envisioned so far, but
# nothing is hard-coded; the index groups by whatever values show up. Leave it
# out and the resource lands under "Other". Spell an existing category exactly
# as it already appears elsewhere — a typo silently starts a second group.
category: Lecture notes

# Who provided it. Plain text, not resolved against _people/ — a resource can
# come from someone with no record here, and this is attribution, not a byline.
# For a preprint this is the author list, in print order, e.g.
# "Jane Doe, John Smith, and Ada Lovelace".
contributor: "José Iovino"

# One plain-text sentence, shown on the index row.
summary: ""

# For a single external link (a book, a repo, a website). Omit if this
# resource is one or more local files instead — use `files:` for those.
# url: https://example.edu/resource

# For one or more local files (lecture notes, slides, datasets, a preprint
# PDF). Same shape as a talk's `references:`. `url` here is a path under
# assets/resources/ in this repo, and is not filtered through the top-level
# `url:` above — an arXiv or DOI link can sit alongside a local PDF as another
# entry in the same list.
